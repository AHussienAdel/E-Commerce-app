including photos, descriptions, price, and seller contact information.
Search and Browse: Users should be able to search for specific items or browse
listings by category, location, or price.
Rating and Feedback: The platform should allow users to rate and provide feedback
on transactions, helping to build trust and credibility among users.

listings, purchases, and feedback from other users.

discuss listings and finalize transactions.
Analytics and Reporting: Provide sellers with charts providing insights into the
performance of their listings and how many items they have sold on the platform.
